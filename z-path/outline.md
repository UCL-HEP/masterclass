# Introduction and getting started (30 mins)

The bare essentials before handing over to the speaker for the ATLAS talk.

- Distribute guest account slips and dataset numbers.
    - work in pairs if possible
    - log in to PC
- Logistics if not already covered:
    - emergency exits
    - refreshments
    - breaks
    - toilets
- Show first few slides from deck:
    - about the masterclass
    - schedule
    - getting started
- Hypatia
    - find and bookmark masterclass web page
    - download Hypatia, unpack, and launch

# Lecture and Q&A session (40 mins)

Arrange signals to let speaker know when running out of time.

OK to overrun a bit if students are engaged and asking good questions.

# Hands-on exercises (pre-lunch) (2 hours)

## Introduce exercise

- SM, Higgs (refer back to ATLAS talk)
- ATLAS detector
- particle signatures

## Identifying particles

- Show masterclass slides: we are looking for Z and H, but these are unstable.
- Instead we have to look for their decay products and reconstruct the parent particle.
- The ATLAS detector is designed to allow us to identify these products and measure their energy and momentum: show diagrams.
- Talk through "Particle footprint visualization" section, and refer to "cheat sheet" for more detailed guide.
- Give students 10 minutes to attempt "Practice" exercise (and get refreshments).

## Identifying events

- Get students to dowload "exercise 2" data file and open in Hypatia.
- Talk through "identifying events" section: Z and H events, background.
- Demonstrate identifying first event, then give students 15 minutes or so to attempt the rest and check their answers.

## Invariant mass

- Show "Search and discover with mass" section and discuss briefly.
- Show masterclass slides: histogram, using Hypatia.
- Get students to download their allocated data set.
- Demo: download data set and analyse first few events.
- Give students some time to start analysing.
- Demonstrate saving and loading Hypatia project so don't lose data when take a break.

## Before the lunch break

Tell students we will need at least two volunteers for the video conference:

- one to answer a question from the moderators about what they have learned today, or how much they already knew about particle physics;
- one to answer a question about today's exercise and what the results show.

There will also be an opportunity for students to ask questions to the moderators, so they should be thinking about anything they might like to ask about e.g.

- today's exercise
- particle physics
- life as a physicist...

Remind participants to save work, and ensure they know when to come back.

# Lunch break (60 minutes)

# Hands-on exercises (post-lunch) (1 hour)

- Load saved Hypatia project.
- Outline remainder of masterclass
    - view histograms in Hypatia
    - will upload data and combine results from whole group
    - moderators in videoconference will combine with other groups
    - moderators will talk about results and ask/answer questions
    - We will stop 15 minutes before the VC to discuss our results,
- Ask for volunteers to ask/answer questions in video conference.
- Continue with work.

# Discussion of results (20 minutes)

- Demonstrate uploading results to OPlot web site.
- Look at combined histograms and discuss peaks etc.
- Show ATLAS 2012 discovery plots for comparison.

# Video conference (60 minutes)

# Summary, Q&A (15 minutes)

Usually people are keen to leave at this point, so keep it short.

Ask for participants to complete feedback survey if there is one.
